### Hi there :sunny:

My name is Tania and I am a Technical Writer <img height="40" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112710487/233798019-fd088341-6628-4b55-92ca-c7f183f6fbcc.png">
I used to be a teacher of English, and then switched to the IT sphere and became a Head of Customer Care. Eventually, I recognized my passion for software, technology, and helping people.
